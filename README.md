# Overview

BigDAWG (Big DAta Working Group) is an open source project from researchers within the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data (ISTC). BigDAWG is a reference implementation of a polystore database. A polystore system is any database management system (DBMS) that is built on top of multiple, heterogeneous, integrated storage engines.

The current release includes support for 3 database engines: PostgreSQL, SciDB and Accumulo. We allow users to easily download Docker containers with middleware, databases and pre-loaded data along with example queries.


# Installation

See the [getting started](http://bigdawg-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) documentation to start a BigDAWG cluster using Docker containers.
